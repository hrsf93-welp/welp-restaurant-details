# welp-restaurant-details

A functional Yelp restaurant page that shows detailed restaurant information, reviews and photos.
For this project, I built the right sidebar that contains 3 main components: 
1. hours component that renders based off of the time the site is viewed
2. menu component that is clickable with photos and reviews
3. restaurant details component that displays more information about the restaurant
