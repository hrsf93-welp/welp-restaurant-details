# welp-restaurant-details

> A functional Yelp restaurant page that shows detailed restaurant information, reviews and photos.
> For this project, I built the right sidebar that contains 3 main components: 
> 1) hours component that renders based off of the time the site is viewed
> 2) menu component that is clickable with photos and reviews
> 3) restaurant details component that displays more information about the restaurant
